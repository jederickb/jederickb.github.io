        Step 1 - set up a composition,
        choose a setting to highlight the focal point of your subject. For instance,
        if you're highlighting a sunset, taking a picture that makes the sunset stick 
        out the most is the most opitmal choice.

        Step 2 - set up camera settings,
        for basics of setting up your camera, you want to make sure you're ISO, aperture,
        and shutter speed are at optimal settings. I have attached a picture so that you can see
        different settings and correlations.

        Step 3 - experiment, the final step is to experiment.
        you can try out different camera settings and take different pictures of your subject at different angles,
        lighting, time of day, etc... you never know what cool picture you can create in this last step!
